        <h2>What Is Art 4 Kidzzz?</h2>
        <p>
          Art 4 Kidzzz is a creative learning initiative designed to inspire children through hands-on art experiences. The project combines imagination, play, and visual expression to help kids explore their creativity and develop confidence.

Our goal is to introduce children to colors, shapes, textures, and artistic techniques in a fun and engaging way. Through art, kids learn to express their emotions, communicate ideas, and discover the joy of creating something uniquely their own.

      <h2 class="learn-title">Creative Growth: What Children Learn Through Art</h2>

      <p class="learn-text">
        Art gives children powerful tools for personal and cognitive development. When kids create, they build fine motor skills, strengthen imagination, and improve problem-solving abilities.

Art-making also supports emotional growth—it teaches patience, focus, and self-expression. Children gain confidence when they see their ideas come to life, and they learn to appreciate the value of effort, practice, and creativity.

Through art, kids develop not only skills but also curiosity, discipline, and a sense of pride in their work.

      <h2>Eric Peralta Natalio "SourButter"</h2>

      <p>
        I’m an artist from Santo Domingo, shaped by street culture, color, and rhythm. Creativity has always been my voice—through design, photography, videography, dance, and the graffiti that first sparked my passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving to the U.S. with my son Maverick pushed me to grow and turned my art into purpose: helping kids tap into the same creative energy that transformed me.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, art is confidence, expression, and freedom. Kids naturally have that spark, and my goal is to help them protect it and grow through creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Art 4 Kidzzz is my way of giving back—a space where children can create, express themselves, and discover who they are through color and imagination.
